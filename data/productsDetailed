Due to the cold weather in Ourika, women had to adapt by making rugs and blankets out of natural wool. In the beginning, the wool was undyed; only in brown and ivory colors, later they started adding colors to the rugs and got more creative design-wise; by adding geometric shapes, symbols and Imazighen letters to the original design.Vintage rugs refer to rugs that are retro. These rugs were mostly woven around mid 20th century, specifically during the 70s, therefore; they hold a lot of nostalgic vibes in them. Moroccan rugs became popular in the West thanks to mid-century modern designers. Le Corbusier is one of the designers who combined the thick Amazigh pile with their own designs. Most of these rugs are Beni Ouarain rugs handwoven by local women, using different palette colors and different shapes and designs that were inspired by their own real-life stories. Their primitive touch was a reason for designers to integrate them in their modern creations. Thus, these vintage Moroccan rugs are a perfect addition for a modernist style.STAR SELLERBecause of your support, we are honored with gratitude to have been selected as a Star Seller shop, and it means so much to us that the work we are so passionate about also resonates with others.

In the Akashic Records, I will ask what are the specific blocks you have to self love from this lifetime or past lifetimes and how you can release these blocks. The recorded reading is 20+ minutes long and will be delivered to you via an mp3 format and a Google link.First, the Records will identify your blocks to loving yourself. They will next provide a guided meditation where each block is released and finally, they will give you new messages and beliefs to replace those you released. Information in the Records is provided by the Masters (Beings who have never been incarnated), Teachers (enlightened Beings who have lived on this planet), and Loved Ones (our ancestors who have passed over from this life). During a Reading, i also request assistance from the guides and angels of the person being read. The specific source of the information I receive is rarely revealed to me.When you order, please send me your FULL LEGAL NAME and your current location.

In this transformational space, insight, guidance and understanding is provided for the person being read.The Akashic Records are accessed through questions. The Records respect free will and for this reason, an Akashic Records reading is not predictive. Questions about timing or what is going to happen are more appropriately asked to a psychic.Readings will be completed in 1-4 (business) days after purchase and will be delivered via a Google drive link to an .mp3 file.
